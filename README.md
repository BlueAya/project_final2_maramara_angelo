## Comments
Using the style tiles and responsive prototype was a really fun way of presenting new designs. I really liked this method and will be saving it for the future.

On a sidenote, when using the HTML Outliner tool, this is what my result was:

1. Pizza Planet
	1. Typography and Visual Effects
		1. Font
		2. Link
		3. Button
	2. Accents
		1. Colors
		2. Images

In order to get this desired result, I decided to remove the h1 and h2 tag around the heading and subheading, and just style those two pieces of text with the default h1 and h2 styles. My reasoning behind this was, since those two particular elements fell within a broader topic, and within the context of this prototype, was just for aesthetics, it would be better to just stylize them with CSS instead of giving them an important html tag. When I actually get to designing the real site and filling it with actual content, this will surely change as the context of my headings will have semantic meaning. I just wanted to explain my thought process behind doing it the way I did.
